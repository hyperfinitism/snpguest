NAME
----
snpguest - Command line tool for managing the AMD SEV-SNP Guest environment.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*snpguest* [GLOBAL_OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND_ARGS] [SUBCOMMAND] [SUBCOMMAND_ARGS]
*snpguest* [_-h, --help_]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
snpguest is a CLI utility for navigating and interacting with the AMD SEV-SNP guest firmware device of a guest system.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
*-q, --quiet*::
    Don't print any output to the console.


COMMANDS
--------
*snpguest report*::
    usage: snpguest report $ATT_REPORT_PATH $REQUEST_FILE [-v, --vmpl] $VMPL [-r, --random] [-p, --platform]

    Requests an attestation report from the AMD Secure Processor (ASP), and writes it to $ATT_REPORT_PATH as raw binary. This command is a wrapper of the SNP_GUEST_REQUEST(MSG_REPORT_REQ) ioctl.
    Without [-p, --platform] or [-r, --random], the user can pass 64 bytes of data in any file format into $REQUEST_FILE to request an attestation report. The request file is interpreted as raw binary, and the first 64 bytes of the binary are sent to the AMD-SP as the request data. The request data will be bound to the REPORT_DATA field in the attestation report.
    With the [-r, --random] flag, this command generates a random data for the request, which will be written into $REQUEST_FILE.
    The [-v, --vmpl] option specifies the Virtual Machine Privilege Level (VMPL) to request an attestation report. The default value is 1. If you specify a higher privilege level (i.e. smaller VMPL value) than the actual one, a firmware error will occur.
    With the [-p, --platform] flag, this command retrieves an attestation report from vTPM instead of the ASP, and writes the Report Data field in the retrieved report into $REQUEST_FILE. This attestation route is available (and mandatory) on Microsoft Azure Confidential VMs with SEV-SNP isolation. This flag requires the `hyperv` feature. Currently, only the pre-generated attestation report can be retrieved with this command.

    arguments:
    $ATT_REPORT_PATH: Specifies the path where the attestation report would be stored.
    $REQUEST_FILE: Specifies the path to the 64-byte request file.

    options:
    -h, --help: show a help message.
    -v, --vmpl: specify the VMPL level the Guest is running on (default: 1).
    -r, --random: Generate 64 random bytes of data for the report request.
    -p, --platform: Get an attestation report from the vTPM NV index (Only available for Azure CVMs).

*snpguest certificates*::
    usage: snpguest certificates $ENCODING $CERTS_DIR

    Requests the VEK certificate chain (ARK, ASK/ASVK and VCEK/VLEK) from host memory (requests extended-config).
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding to store the certificates in (PEM or DER). Currently, only PEM and DER encodings are supported.
    All certificates will be in the same encoding.
    The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the certificates will be stored.
    If certificates already exist in the provided directory, they will be overwritten.

    arguments:
    $ENCODING: Specify the certificate encoding to store the certificates in (PEM or DER).
    $CERTS_DIR: Specify the directory to store the certificates in.

    options:
    -h, --help: show a help message

*snpguest fetch ca*::
    usage: snpguest fetch ca $ENCODING $CERTS_DIR $PROCESSOR_MODEL [-r, --report] $ATT_REPORT_PATH [-e, --endorser] $ENDORSEMENT

    Requests the certificate authority chain (ARK & ASK/ASVK) from the KDS.
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding to store the certificates in (PEM or DER). Both certificates will be in the same encoding.
    The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the certificates will be stored. If the certificates already exist in the provided directory, they will be overwritten.
    The user must specify either the host processor model or the path to an attestation report using the [-r, --report] option. When the report is provided, the command attempts to infer the host processor model from fields embedded in the report.
    The [-e, --endorser] option specifies the type of attestation signing key (defaults to VCEK).

    arguments:
    $ENCODING: Specify the certificate encoding to store the certificates in (PEM or DER).
    $CERTS_DIR: Specify the directory to store the certificates in.

    -e, --endorser: Specify the endorser type, possible values: "vcek", "vlek" (default: "vcek").

*snpguest fetch vcek*::
    usage: snpguest fetch vcek $ENCODING $CERTS_DIR $ATT_REPORT_PATH [-p, --processor-model] $PROCESSOR_MODEL

    Requests the VCEK certificate from the KDS.
    The user needs to specify the certificate encoding to store the certificate in (PEM or DER). Currently, only PEM and DER encodings are supported. The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the VCEK will be stored. If the certificate already exists in the provided directory, it will be overwritten.
    To get the REPORTED_TCB and CHIP_ID, the user needs to provide the path to a stored attestation report.
    The user can specify the host processor model using the [-p, --processor-model] option. If the processor model is not specified, the command attempts to infer the host processor model from the report contents.

    arguments:
    $ENCODING: Specify the certificate encoding to store the certificates in (PEM or DER).
    $CERTS_DIR: Specify the directory to store the certificates in.

    Requests the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) from the KDS.
    It takes the same set of arguments as snpguest fetch ca.
    The user needs to specify the encoding to store the CRL in (PEM or DER).
    The user also needs to provide the path to the directory where the CRL will be stored. If the CRL already exists in the provided directory, it will be overwritten.
    The user must either specify the host processor model or pass an attestation report using the [-r, --report] flag.
    When the report is provided, the command attempts to infer the host processor model from fields embedded in the report.

    -r, --report: Specify the attestation report to detect the host processor model (conflict with $PROCESSOR_MODEL).
    -e, --endorser: Specify the endorser type, possible values: "vcek", "vlek" (default: "vcek").


*snpguest verify certs*::
    usage: snpguest verify certs $CERTS_DIR

    Verifies that the provided certificate chain has been properly signed by each certificate.

    An error will be raised if the attestation verification fails at any point.
    The user can specify the host processor model using the [-p, --processor-model] option. If the processor model is not specified, the command attempts to infer the host processor model from the report contents.
    The user can use the [-t, --tcb] flag to skip the signature validation.
    The user can use the [-s, --signature] flag to skip the reported TCB validation.
    The user can use the [-m, --measurement] flag to verify that the measurement in the attestation report matches the expected measurement value (prefix with 0x for hex).

*snpguest key*::
    usage: snpguest key $KEY_PATH $ROOT_KEY_SELECT [-v, --vmpl] $VMPL [-g, --guest_field_select] $GFS [-s, --guest_svn] $GSVN [-t, --tcb_version] $TCBV [-l, --launch_mit_vector] $LMV

    Requests the derived key from the AMD-SP based on input parameters, and stores it into $KEY_PATH. This command is a wrapper of the SNP_GUEST_REQUEST(MSG_KEY_REQ) ioctl of the AMD-SP.
    The user must specifies the root key $ROOT_KEY_SELECT from which to derive the key (either "vcek" or "vmrk").
    The [-g, --guest_field_select] option is a bit field of length 64, which specifies which data field will be mixed into the derived key. Each of the bits from right to left correspond to Guest Policy, Image ID, Family ID, Measurement, SVN and TCB Version, Launch Mitigation Vector, respectively. For each bit, 0 denotes off, and 1 denotes on.
    The [-v, --vmpl] option specifies the VMPL the Guest is running on and defaults to 1. The default value is 1. If you specify a higher privilege level than is actually available (i.e. a lower VMPL value), a firmware error will occur.
    The [-g, --guest_svn] option specifies the guest SVN to mix into the key.
    The [-t, --tcb_version] option specifies the TCB version to mix into the derived key (must not exceed the committed TCB)
    The [-l, --launch_mit_vector] option specifies the launch mitigation vector value to mix into the derived key.
    Note that the launch mitigation vector is only available for the MSG_KEY_REQ message version 2 or later.

    arguments:
    $KEY_PATH: Specify the path to store the derived key.
    $ROOT_KEY_SELECT: Specify the root key from which to derive the key (either "vcek" or "vmrk").

    -s, --guest_svn: Specify the guest SVN to mix into the key (decimal, prefixed hex or prefixed bin) (default: 0).
    -t, --tcb_version: Specify the TCB version to mix into the derived key (decimal, prefixed hex or prefixed bin) (default: 0). Must not exceed the commited TCB.
    -l, --launch_mit_vector: Specify the launch mitigation vector value to mix into the derived key (decimal, prefixed hex or prefixed bin). Only available for MSG_KEY_REQ message version 2 or later.

*snpguest ok*::
	usage: snpguest ok

    Performs a quick local check such as CPUID and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) to see if the SEV-SNP feature appears enabled in the guest environment.
    Note that this command is only a sanity check and does not provide a cryptographic guarantee that the SEV-SNP is definitely valid. To obtain strict cryptographic assurance for the SEV-SNP, the user must perform remote attestation.
    This command requires that the `msr` module is loaded.

*snpguest generate measurement*::
    usage: snpguest generate measurement [-v, --vcpus] [--vcpu-type] [--vcpu-sig] [--vcpu-family] [--vcpu-model] [--vcpu-stepping] [-t, --vmm-type] [-o ,--ovmf] [-k, --kernel]
            [-i, --initrd] [-a, --append] [-g, --guest-features] [--ovmf-hash] [-f, --output-format] [-m, --measurement-file]

    Calculates a secure guest expected launch digest measurement.
    Every parameter passed in is used to calculate this measurement, but the user does not need to provide every parameter.
    The only mandatory parameters are the [-o, --ovmf] parameter which is a path to the ovmf file used to launch the secure guest, and provide the guest vcpu type.
    There are 3 ways to provide the vcpu type, and the 3 of them are mutually exclusive (will get an error if the user tries to use more than one method):
        - [--vcpu-type] A string with the vcpu-type used to launch the secure guest
        - [--vcpu-sig] The signature of the vcpu-type used to launch the secure guest
        - [--vcpu-family] [--vcpu-model] [--vcpu-stepping] The family, model and stepping of the vcpu used to launch the secure guest.
            Family, model and stepping have to be used together, if they're not all provided together an error will be raised.
    If the user provides the [-k, --kernel] parameter to calculate the measurement, they also need to provide [-i, --initrd] and [-a, --append].
    There were kernel features added that affect the result of the measurement if those are enabled. With the [-g, --guest-features] parameter the user can provide which of this features are enabled in their kernel.
    The [-g, --guest-features] can be a hex or decimal number that cover the features enabled.
    For information on the guest-features bitfield checkout: https://github.com/virtee/sev/blob/main/src/measurement/vmsa.rs
    A user can use a pre-calculated ovmf-hash using [--ovmf-hash], but the ovmf file still has to be provided.
    The calculated measurement will be printed in the console. If the user wishes to store the measurement value they can provide a file path with [-m, --measurement-file] and the measurement will get written there.
    If the [--quiet] flag is used, nothing will be printed out.

    options:
    -h, --help      Show a help message
    -v, --vcpus     Number of guest vcpus [default: 1]
